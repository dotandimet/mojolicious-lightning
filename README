This folder contains the following:

 - frontpage - a mojolicious lite app, identical to the 2nd example on the
   http://mojolicio.us front page.

 - front_page_full - a mojolicious full app, expanded from the example above.
   The logic is in the FrontPageFull::Controller::Example module, it includes
   both an example with a text input, and an example with an async response.

   Also a widget for getting the full text for haaretz.co.il subscription-only
   articles, because it was so trivial to implement.
